              Our mission is to support young women in furthering their interest and
              knowledge in computer science through engaging activities and
              empowerment. Since 1984, the number of women pursuing a degree in
              computer science has decreased from 37% to 18% and only 24% of the
              industry is women. Lots of initiatives and programs have started with
              the goal of raising those numbers, but haven’t had the results they
              desired.

              As female programmers in high school, we know what the environment is
              like more than anyone. We’ve seen our friends decide to stop
              programming and the ratio of men to women in the class only increases
              each year. Our observations are not unique. Over half the women
              enrolled in computer science classes are in middle school or younger
              and only 4% are in college. What happens to those girls that started
              so early? Why do they decide to stop?
            </p>

              It’s easy to get women to start programming, but retaining them has
              been a challenge. We believe this is because past the beginner level,
              there is little support for women in STEM. The pressure and bias faced
              in male-dominated classrooms repels young women and the lack of social
              opportunities is isolating. We aim to change that. Our program is
              unique because it has opportunities for girls who already possess
              beginner-level knowledge in coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              If nothing is changed, the percentage of women in computer science
              will go down from 24% to 22% by 2027. We see a need within our
              community, and around the world, so we’ve decided to do something
              about it. Our goal is to create a safe and fun space for female
              programmers to grow and learn together. The objective is not to get
              girls interested in wonderful world of programming, but to keep them
              motivated and confident.

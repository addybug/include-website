                  <p>
                    Adison Lampert is a senior at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy.
                    She has been a part of multiple initiatives to increase the number of women
                    in STEM including her role as one of the ten US Ambassadors for Tech
                    Girls 2020 and her position as president of the Women in Computer Science
                    club at her school. After many years of observing the diminishing female
                    population in her computer science classes, she couldn’t help
                    but ask herself why. That’s when the idea for def include( ) was
                    born. She hopes that her experience and knowledge about the
                    challenges faced by middle school and high school girls in
                    computer science can help girls like her to feel more confident
                    and comfortable in their classes. She aspires to pursue a degree in
                    Computer Science and eventually end up in the field of Emotion AI.

                    Julia Ding is a sophomore at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy.
                    Having been fortunate enough to have had a relatively early exposure
                    to computer science, she has taken a great interest in the subject
                    and has been deeply involved in it ever since. She is passionate about
                    increasing the diversity of females in computer science and other
                    technological fields, and aims to do so first handedly. Aside from
                    computer science, Julia enjoys mathematics as well as playing the cello.

                    Cierra Wickliff is a senior at the Liberal Arts and Science
                    Academy High School. She has taken several years of computer
                    science and wishes to pursue it as a career. After noticing the
                    lack of female representation in the tech industry, she was
                    happy to join the def include( ) team. In addition to Cierra’s
                    current role, she also contributed to the design of the website.
                    She hopes to inspire more girls to pursue a career in computer
                    science. Besides her involvement with def include( ), she spends
                    her time coding, reading, and watching youtube.

                    of women in computer science first-hand, she is a strong
                    proponent of increasing diversity in computer science. Lily is
                    excited to be a part of the def include( ) team and have the
                    opportunity to make a difference in this amazing field. In

                    Christelle Chatelain is a senior at LASA. She has recently
                    become very interested in the world of technology and computers,
                    and hopes to one day implement it in her future career. She
                    enjoys programming, however she has unfortunately noticed a lack
                    of female representation in her computer science classes.
                    Knowing that she wanted this to change, she joined the def

                    musical genres and baking desserts.

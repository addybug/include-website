                              You use websites every day for activities like accessing your school
                              assignments and posting on social media, but what exactly is a website
                              and how are they created? Web development is a versatile skill that
                              gives creators the opportunity to express themselves creatively through
                              code. Almost every interest has an application in web development.
                              Whether you’re interested in entrepreneurship, activism, or anything
                              in between, there is a place for you in web development. Join us for
                              this 2.5 month class to learn the web development skills you’ll need
                              to put your big idea into motion. Live classes will be held on Saturday
                              mornings for 1.5 hours and one project will be assigned a week that
                              should take no longer than 30 minutes a day to complete.

                            The class is a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous learning. The
                            lessons are not mandatory and will be recorded, but it is
                            recommended you attend to get the most out of the course. You can find the
                            Zoom link by navigating to the correct week under "Weekly Assignments."
                            During the week, you will work on the project given to you and submit it. Office hours will
                            be held throughout the week to support you. If you
                            submit all of the assignments, you will receive a certificate of
                            completion at the end of the course.
